# Sentiment Analysis with Azure AI â€“ Language Studio

This project is part of the DIO Bootcamp with Avanade. The goal is to perform sentiment analysis using Azure AI's Language Studio tool.

## ðŸ§  What I Did

- Collected a few real-life user review sentences about products, hotels, and services.
- Saved the inputs in a text file: `inputs/user-reviews-input.txt`
- Used Azure AI's Language Studio to analyze the sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) of each sentence.
- Observed the output and took screenshots of the results.

## ðŸ“¥ Example Sentences Used

Some examples from the input file:

### Product:

"After trying several brands, this wireless headphone exceeded my expectations. The sound quality is crisp, the battery lasts over 30 hours, and the noise cancellation works surprisingly well, even in crowded environments. Totally worth the price!"

## ðŸ’¡ Insights

- The AI correctly detected different levels of sentiment across various sentence structures.
- Longer and more detailed reviews were analyzed with more nuance.
- This tool can be useful for analyzing customer feedback in real-time.

## ðŸš€ Possibilities

This type of sentiment analysis can be used in:

- Customer service feedback
- E-commerce product reviews
- Hotel and travel platforms
- Social media monitoring
