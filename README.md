# Sentiment Analysis with Azure AI â€“ Language Studio

This project is part of the DIO Bootcamp with Avanade. The goal is to perform sentiment analysis using Azure AI's Language Studio tool.

## ðŸ§  What I Did

- Collected a few real-life user review sentences about products, hotels, and services.
- Saved the input sentences in a text file: `inputs/sentiment-samples.txt`
- Used Azure AI's Language Studio to analyze the sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) of each sentence.
- Reviewed the results and took screenshots of the output.

## ðŸ“¥ Example Sentences Used

Some examples from the input file:

### ðŸŸ¢ Product:

*"After trying several brands, this wireless headphone exceeded my expectations. The sound quality is crisp, the battery lasts over 30 hours, and the noise cancellation works surprisingly well, even in crowded environments. Totally worth the price!"*

### ðŸ”´ Service:

*"I was extremely disappointed with the cleaning service. Not only did they arrive 45 minutes late, but they also left several areas untouched, despite my clear instructions. When I tried to address the issue with customer support, they were dismissive and offered no real solution. Definitely not booking again."*
