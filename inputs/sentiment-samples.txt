"After trying several brands, this wireless headphone exceeded my expectations. The sound quality is crisp, the battery lasts over 30 hours, and the noise cancellation works surprisingly well, even in crowded environments. Totally worth the price!"

Hotel:
The hotel is located in a very convenient area, close to shops and public transportation. The staff was polite and the check-in process was smooth. However, the room itself felt outdated, and the Wi-Fi connection was unstable, which made working remotely a bit frustrating.

Service:
I was extremely disappointed with the cleaning service. Not only did they arrive 45 minutes late, but they also left several areas untouched, despite my clear instructions. When I tried to address the issue with customer support, they were dismissive and offered no real solution. Definitely not booking again.
